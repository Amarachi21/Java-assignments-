Introduction (What the project/assignment does )

Our assignment is  visual art piece that can also double down as a simulation for the user or viewer. Our assignment responds to the music that is playing or that we chose for it work with. Our assignment is inspired by the idea of a 90s video game. But more of the dance versions. We decided to simplify it down to just a visual art piece as a mutual decision of the group so that it would be easier for us to work with and wouldn’t be too overwhelming for the user or viewer. So we simplified it down to the movements of the shapes and lines in order to mimic the normal arrows that would usually be in the game. An example of this would be Dance Dance Revolution and Just Dance. As a group we all had to do self directed learning on the project in order to come up with ideas with help from the internet we were able to find and use code that we haven't done in the class.

The Controls 
The controls that were used for this assignment/project were the colour changes that were made to match the tempo of the song, the lines along the sonde of the background had pulsating movements in order to mimic the base of the song. We also added the movement of the shapes in order to make the user or viewer l feel like they we’re moving thorough the assignment along with the song. The whole visual art piece would slow down or speed up in order to match the song when it would also slow down or pick up the pace. The whole assignment would change colour at the same time when the tempo of the song would change as well. But we also isolate some of the shapes so that they don’t change colour when the others do to give it some contrast.

Implementation (How to make the project/assignment run)
When the run button at the top of the compiler is selected or clicked you should be immediately be redirected to set to another page with the output running. There you should see the visual art piece implemented and working as it was described and meant to run.

 Conclusion (Things we are most proud of)
We are most proud of our team work and how we were able to be considerate towards each other. When someone’s code wouldn’t work we would work together and help them out and also explain the work to them. We are also proud of the implementation and the outcome of our Project and how it matched our vision.
