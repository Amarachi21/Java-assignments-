So we simplified it down to the movements of the shapes and lines in order to mimic the normal arrows that would usually be in the game. An example of this would be Dance Dance Revolution and Just Dance. As a group we all had to do self directed learning on the project in order to come up with ideas with help from the internet we were able to find and use code that we haven't done in the class.
